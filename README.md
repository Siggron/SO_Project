# SO_Project
Operating Systems

This project was developed as part of the Operating Systems course and involved implementing a program monitoring service on a machine.
There are two programs:
* The client (tracer), which allows users to execute programs and obtain their execution time.
* The server (monitor), which allows for querying the currently running programs, their execution times up to that moment, and also provides statistics on completed programs.

The main focus of the project is on concurrent programming, and the topics covered include:
1. File access
2. Process creation and management
3. Program execution
4. Anonymous pipes
5. Named pipes
6. File descriptor redirection
